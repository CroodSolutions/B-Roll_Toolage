This is a joke repo, where we will refactor some of our red team tools to with the one and only payload of a Rick Roll video, for the betterment of society. And, there may also be the occasional Hasslehoff wallpaper as well. Use only for legal and ethical testing and pranking purposes, on systems you own or where you have written permission. 

In case you need help to understand the scope and purpose of this project, please watch the tutorial below.
